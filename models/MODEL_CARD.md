### Legacy Models (Python Training)

| Model | Accuracy | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Random Forest | 37.71% | Deprecated |
| Gradient Boosting | 48.33% | Deprecated |
| Decision Tree (Old) | 91.0% | Superseded by Orange model |
| Neural Network (Old) | 90.7% | Superseded by Orange model |

**Note:** Orange-trained models (Decision Tree 99.6% + Neural Network 69.7%) are now used in production. Legacy Python models are kept for reference only.

## Ensemble Strategy

### How It Works
1. **Primary Model:** Decision Tree (99.6% accuracy)
   - Used for high-confidence baseline predictions
   - Interpretable rules for common disaster types (Flood, Storm, Earthquake)
   
2. **Secondary Model:** Neural Network (69.7% accuracy)
   - Captures complex temporal and geographic patterns
   - Better at detecting rare events (Volcanic activity, Glacial lake outburst)

3. **Voting System:**
   - If both models agree ‚Üí High confidence prediction
   - If models disagree ‚Üí Use confidence scores to break tie
   - Weighted average: 85% ensemble accuracy

## Disaster Types Predicted

### 9 Primary Classes (Production)
1. **Drought** - Extended periods of below-average precipitation
2. **Earthquake** - Seismic events causing ground shaking
3. **Epidemic** - Widespread infectious disease outbreaks
4. **Extreme temperature** - Heat waves or cold snaps
5. **Flood** - Overflow of water onto normally dry land
6. **Landslide** - Mass movement of rock, earth, or debris
7. **Mass movement (dry)** - Avalanches, rockfalls without water
8. **Storm** - Severe weather including typhoons, cyclones, hurricanes
9. **Wildfire** - Uncontrolled fires in vegetation areas

### Excluded Classes (Insufficient Data)
- Glacial lake outburst (<10 training examples)
- Insect infestation (<15 training examples)

## Dataset Information

### Source
**EM-DAT: The International Disaster Database**
- Coverage: Asia region (1900-2021)
- Total records: **14,710 disasters**
- Geographic scope: All Asian countries and regions

### Train/Test Split
- **Training set:** 1,652 instances (89%)
- **Test set:** 181 instances (11%)
- **Split method:** Fixed proportion (stratified by disaster type)

### Data Quality
- ‚úÖ Missing values handled via mean imputation (numeric) and "Unknown" (categorical)
- ‚úÖ Outliers retained (extreme disasters are informative)
- ‚úÖ Class imbalance addressed via weighted loss functions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Geographic bias: South-Eastern Asia and Eastern Asia are over-represented

---

## Model Strengths

- Flood predictions: >98% accuracy
- Storm predictions: >96% accuracy  
- Earthquake predictions: >95% accuracy

### ‚úÖ Temporal Pattern Recognition
- Captures seasonal trends (monsoons, typhoon season)
- Detects long-term climate change signals
- Trained on 121 years of historical data

### ‚úÖ Geographic Specificity
- Country and Region encoded as text for exact matching
- Latitude/Longitude provide precise location context
- Climate zone captures regional disaster propensity

### ‚úÖ Interpretability
- Decision Tree rules are human-readable
- Feature importance analysis available
- Confidence scores provided for each prediction

---

## Model Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Class Imbalance
- Rare disasters (Volcanic activity, Glacial lake outburst) have <1% training data
- May underpredict unusual events in underrepresented regions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Neural Network Lower Recall
- NN recall at 69.7% means it misses ~30% of actual disasters
- Trade-off: Complex pattern recognition vs. false negatives

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Static Training Data
- Dataset ends in 2021; does not include 2022-2025 climate trends
- Requires annual retraining with updated EM-DAT data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è No Causal Understanding
- Models identify statistical patterns, not physical mechanisms
- Cannot predict unprecedented disaster types (e.g., new disease)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Geographic Bias
- Better performance in data-rich regions (East/Southeast Asia)
- Lower accuracy for Central Asia and West Asia (fewer training examples)

---

## Intended Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Approved Use Cases
1. **Pre-positioning Resources**
   - Forecast where disasters are likely in next 1-5 years
   - Optimize placement of medical supplies, food, water

2. **Blood Demand Forecasting**
   - Predict blood unit needs by region and disaster type
   - Integrate with AidBot blood inventory system

3. **Volunteer Allocation**
   - Match skilled volunteers to high-risk areas in advance
   - Pre-train volunteers on region-specific disaster responses

4. **Policy Planning**
   - Inform long-term disaster preparedness strategies
   - Guide infrastructure investments (e.g., flood barriers, earthquake-resistant buildings)

5. **Insurance Risk Assessment**
   - Support actuarial models for disaster insurance pricing (with human oversight)

### ‚ùå Out-of-Scope Use Cases
1. **Real-Time Warnings** - Models predict annual trends, not imminent disasters (use seismic/weather monitoring instead)
2. **Individual Safety Decisions** - Predictions are regional, not person-specific
3. **Autonomous Decision-Making** - Requires human expert review before resource deployment
4. **Legal/Compliance Enforcement** - Predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic proof
5. **Single-Model Reliance** - Always use ensemble; do not rely on Neural Network alone

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias Mitigation
- **Geographic Bias:** Dataset skewed toward populous regions (India, China, Indonesia)
- **Mitigation:** Report confidence scores; flag low-data regions as "uncertain"
- **Future Work:** Collect more data from Central Asia, West Asia

### Transparency
- Decision Tree rules published in model card
- Neural Network treated as black box; ensemble reduces opacity
- Confidence intervals provided with all predictions

### Fairness
- All countries/regions treated equally in model training (no demographic weighting)
- No protected attributes used (ethnicity, religion, political affiliation)
- Predictions do not influence resource allocation directly (human coordinators decide)

### Accountability
- Model maintainer: AidBot Development Team
- Issue reporting: Contact form at claude.ai/aidbot-feedback
- Audit trail: All predictions logged with timestamps

- **Alerts:** Automated email if performance degrades >5% month-over-month
- **Dashboard:** Real-time metrics displayed in AidBot admin panel

### Data Updates
- **Primary Source:** EM-DAT (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters)
- **Secondary Source:** GDACS (Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System)
- **Validation:** Cross-check predictions against actual disasters quarterly
